# NexusAI Payment System - Production Ready

## ✅ Current Working Endpoints

### Credit Purchase (Primary)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/credits/purchase`
- **Minimum**: $5.00 USD  
- **Rate**: 1000 credits per $1 USD
- **Parameters**:
  ```json
  {
    "amount": 5.00,
    "phone_number": "+231881158457", 
    "user_id": "your_user_id"
  }
  ```

### Credit Packages Info
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/credits/packages`
- **Returns**: Available packages and credit conversion rates

### User Credits Balance  
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/user/{user_id}/credits`
- **Returns**: Current credit balance for user

## 🚀 Production Configuration

### Minimum Amount: $5.00
- **Payment Processor**: Updated to $5.00 minimum
- **API Gateway**: Validates $5.00 minimum  
- **MTN Payment**: Enforces $5.00 minimum
- **Starter Package**: 5,000 credits for $5.00

### Credit Rate: 1000 credits per $1 USD
- $5.00 = 5,000 credits
- $10.00 = 10,000 credits  
- $50.00 = 50,000 credits

## 🗑️ Removed Endpoints (No Longer Available)
- `~/api/v1/payment/mtn/request~` - Old package-based system
- `~/api/v1/payment/packages~` - Replaced by `/api/v1/credits/packages`
- `~/api/v1/payment/status/{reference_id}~` - Integrated into purchase flow

## ✅ Testing Verification
- ❌ $1.00 payment correctly rejected with "Minimum purchase amount is $5.00"
- ✅ $5.00 payment passes validation and proceeds to MTN processing
- ✅ Credit calculation: $5.00 = 5,000 credits automatically allocated
- ✅ Database persistence with transaction audit trail
- ✅ Idempotency protection via unique transaction IDs

## 🎯 Next Steps
System is production-ready with:
- $5.00 minimum amount enforced
- Clean endpoint structure  
- Proper error handling
- Database persistence
- Comprehensive testing

Ready for deployment! 🚀
