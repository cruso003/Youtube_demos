# NexusAI Platform Architecture

## Service Separation Strategy

### **Landing Page (nexus-landing)** 🏠

**Purpose**: Customer-facing interface and account management

- **Authentication & Authorization**: User registration, login, OAuth
- **Dashboard**: API key management, usage analytics, billing
- **Admin Panel**: User management, system monitoring
- **Marketing**: Landing pages, pricing, documentation
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration, subscription management

### **AI Service (agent_platform)** 🤖

**Purpose**: Core AI processing and business logic

- **AI Processing**: Model inference, adapter routing
- **Business Logic**: Domain-specific AI workflows
- **API Endpoints**: Stateless processing endpoints
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and throughput
- **Security**: API key validation, rate limiting

## Why This Separation?

### 1. **Security & Data Isolation** 🔒

```bash
Landing Page (Customer Data)    AI Service (Processing Only)
├── User accounts              ├── No customer data storage
├── Payment info               ├── Stateless operations
├── Usage analytics            ├── API key validation only
└── Admin controls             └── Pure AI processing
```

### 2. **Scalability** 📈

- **Landing Page**: Scales with user base (hundreds/thousands)
- **AI Service**: Scales with API requests (millions/billions)
- Independent scaling based on different load patterns

### 3. **Compliance & Governance** ⚖️

- **Landing Page**: Handles PII, requires GDPR/SOC2 compliance
- **AI Service**: No PII, focused on AI model security
- Separate audit trails and data governance

### 4. **Development & Deployment** 🚀

- **Landing Page**: Frontend-heavy, marketing iterations
- **AI Service**: Backend-heavy, model updates, performance optimization
- Teams can work independently with clear boundaries

### 5. **Business Model** 💰

- **Landing Page**: Customer acquisition, retention, monetization
- **AI Service**: Core product value, technical excellence
- Clear separation of business vs. technical concerns

## Real-World Examples

### **Stripe Model** 💳

- **Dashboard** (dashboard.stripe.com): Account management, analytics
- **API** (api.stripe.com): Payment processing only

### **OpenAI Model** 🧠

- **Platform** (platform.openai.com): API keys, usage, billing
- **API** (api.openai.com): Model inference only

### **AWS Model** ☁️

- **Console** (console.aws.amazon.com): Resource management
- **Services** (*.amazonaws.com): Individual service endpoints

## Our Implementation Benefits

### **For Customers** 👥

- Clean separation of account management vs. API usage
- Dashboard doesn't affect API performance
- Clear billing and usage tracking

### **For Operations** 🔧

- API service can be deployed globally for low latency
- Dashboard can be regional for compliance
- Independent monitoring and alerting

### **For Business** 📊

- Customer success team focuses on landing page/dashboard
- Engineering team focuses on AI service performance
- Clear metrics for business vs. technical KPIs

## Data Flow

```bash
Customer → Landing Page → Generates API Key
Customer → AI Service (with API key) → Gets AI Response
AI Service → Usage metrics → Landing Page Dashboard
```

This architecture is industry standard for API-first businesses and ensures:

- **Performance**: AI service isn't slowed by dashboard features
- **Security**: Customer data separate from processing logic  
- **Scalability**: Each service scales independently
- **Compliance**: Clear data boundaries for regulations
